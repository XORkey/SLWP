\section{Lost keys}
However helpful the computer is with the handling of the login procedure, logging in still is a human task.
Using a keyring simplifies the task of remembering things and keeping administration; selecting a key number reduces typing.

Still, things need to be remembered, kept safe, and backed up.
It is sad to conclude that,
although excellent in some areas,
humans do not excel at these precise tasks.
Key numbers will be forgotten,
their administration mislaid,
or the PIN for opening the keyring in the first place.
Keyrings will be irretrievably lost due to inadvertent removal or hard disk crashes.
That, in itself, is not so bad,
should a backup copy be available at all times.
Alas, humans excel in forgetting to make regular backups of their most vital things.
\par
Given human nature, it is best to be prepared for the inevitable.

\subsubsection{Keynumber forgotten}
The user has no clue which of its keys should be used for a particular site.
The key that has been tried does not seem to work.
