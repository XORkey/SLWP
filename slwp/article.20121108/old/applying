\subsection{Applying for a userid}
\label{sec:applying}
When a new user applies for an account, it should choose a userid%
---one that the website will accept as unique.
Furthermore, it should select the index of a hitherto unused key
(therefore, a dummy).
The user will send its $\E{SHA}$ hash of its userid,
along with its dummy key $K_d$ to the website.
\par
The website will send the dummy key $K_d$ to an SDPS hosting an HSM (see section \ref{sec:SDPS}),
which will do the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Generate a random
\[K_s=\mathtt{Random}()\]
which will be the new site key for this user.
\item Then it will encrypt the $K_s$ with the current Secret key $S[0]$ to yield the new user key $K_u$
\[K_u=\E{AES}(K_s, S[0])\]
\item Finally, the new user key is encrypted with the user's dummy key $K_d$
with an XOR operation:
\[K_x=K_u \oplus K_d\]
\end{enumerate}
The SDPS will then send the new key $K_s$ and the $\E{SHA}$ hash of the userid to the server hosting the accounts database.
It will send $K_x$ in a mail to the new user (optionally with the index the user supplied).
\par
The user's keyring program can import the new key $K_x$ into the keyring by calculating
\[K_u=K_x \oplus K_d\]
using the index it has originally selected for the slot in the keyring.
The dummy key $K_d$ is overwritten with the new key $K_u$.
