\Subsection{Password manager}
Although I like to use the phrase ``password'' as little as possible in this document for obvious reasons,
I fear that even when this protocol is adapted globally and ubiquitously,
any program that aides with logging in will be called a password manager,
despite its inaptness.
That is because there allways will be passwords.
Not all passwords are bad in all circumstances; better alternatives are not always better suited.
\Subsubsection{Passwords and keys}
The password manager will provide keys to the browser of the user that wants to login, just as it presents passwords now.
The only thing different in this scenario that it will inject a key in an appropriate HTML input element on the login page, instead of a password.
The login logic on that page (most likely JavaScript for years to come) will handle the local calculations, and there you have it.
