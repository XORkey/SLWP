\subsection{The keyring}
The keyring is a set of keys,
stored somewhere,
where each key is a random number.
\subsubsection{Storing the keyring}
Storing the keyring may be done as seemed fit.
It may be stored as a file on disk,
or individual keys may be put in a database.
The level of security regarding the keyring must match the level of confidentiality required for the accounts it is used to log in.
It is,
however,
not part of the proof of the security of this protocol.
Frankly said:
if you loose your keys,
you're dead.
\subsubsection{Keys on the keyring}
The first key on the ring
($Z[0]$)
is 128 bits in size and is the keyring identifier and is not used for logging in.
\par
Other keys are all stored as a 128 bit value,
but only a subset of its bits are actually used as a key,
determined by the website.
The protocol allows for keys of as little as a single bit.
