						<h1>Secure Login Without Passwords (SLWP)</h1>

					<p>	XORkey introduces: Secure Login Without Passwords, an authentication method that does away with passwords.</p>

						<h2>Advantages</h2>
					</header>
					<p>This way of logging in has the following benefits.
					<ul>
					<li>Obviously, there are no passwords any more for sites that adopt SLWP.<br>
						<i>So, there are no dozens of them for you to remember.</i>
					<li>No centrally stored passwords that can be stolen by the millions, including yours.<br>
						<i>Instead, the keys that are centrally stored are useless for logging in from a client.</i>
					<li>The website needs to prove it can decrypt your encrypted random number.<br>
						<i>A phishing site is unable to do so, thus eliminating this threat.</i>
					<li>It is a two-factor authentication method by design and easily upgraded to multi-factor authentication.<br>
						<i>A combination of something you know, and/or something you have, and/or something you are.<br>Just add hardware tokens and biometrics for one or more persons to make it multi-factor.</i>
					<li>Logging in can be fully automated.<br>
						<i>Just hit the login button on the website and you're in.</i>
					<li>You can pick just any username you want for any and all accounts you have; no clashes with other people's accounts.<br>
						<i>"That account is already taken" is a thing from the past.</i>
					<li>Accounts cannot be linked by colluding websites to the same person.<br>
						<i>Your anonimity is protected, unless you leave your name...</i>
					<li>Login keys are automatically and periodically changed.<br>
						<i>You are not aware of rekeying but will enhance security.</i>
					</ul>
					<header>
						<h2>Disadvantages</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Surely, there are disadvantages.</p>
					<ul>
					<li>You have to have your keys, otherwise you are not able to login.</br>
						<i>Not in a million years.</i>
					</ul>
